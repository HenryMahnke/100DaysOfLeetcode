Over the summer I have found myself with a lot of time. Despite working extra in my research lab, and learning about AI over the summer, I am trying to have some diversity, and more to show in terms of coding, as I often am too nervous to publish to the world. It's something I'm working on, but until then, and for the next 100 days. I'm doing a challenge. Each day, do a leetcode problem, I have to finish it that day. I may add something where I can swap days and such but that is not the idea for right now. In addition, I'm may add fun sub challenges along the way, like trying neovim, or using notepad++ or something, but until then, just regular old vs code, with inline autocomplete off, no help from LLMs and a deadline to finish it. If i get stuck, I'm not sure what the procedure will be, but will make it up as I go. I will also be doing a review after every problem of common gotchas, or what I liked, what I didn't, what was hard, what was easy, or what was fun. I'm really excited for this challenge, because checking off each problem is really satisfying. Currently I am drawing from the Leetcode Top Interview 150, but will see if that's actually interesting. After my algorithms and data structures class, that was really uninteresting, I'm really looking for tricky problems, and ready for some DP which I never thought I'd say. 

Excited for the next 100 days.
